Analyze the results of the 2017-2019 StackOverflow surveys

CRISP-DM
Following Steps were followed:

1. Business Understanding

    1. Years coded professionally has an effect on why and how often people visit StackOverflow?
    2. Are people who work remotely more satisfied by their job?
    3. How does the popularity of different programming languages look like over the last three years?

2. Data Understanding

The StackOverflow data from they 2017, 2018 and 2019 survey were used in order to answer the questions above. For questions 1. and 2. only data from the 2019 survey were looked at. For the 3rd question the popularity trend of different languages over 3 years was considered, hence all three datasets were used.

3. Prepare Data

This is commonly denoted as 80% of the process. You saw this especially when attempting to build a model to predict salary, and there was still much more you could have done. From working with missing data to finding a way to work with categorical variables, and we didn't even look for outliers or attempt to find points we were especially poor at predicting. There was ton more we could have done to wrangle the data, but you have to start somewhere, and then you can always iterate.

4. Model Data

We were finally able to model the data, but we had some back and forth with step 3. before we were able to build a model that had okay performance. There still may be changes that could be done to improve the model we have in place. From additional feature engineering to choosing a more advanced modeling technique, we did little to test that other approaches were better within this lesson.

5. Results

Results are the findings from our wrangling and modeling. They are the answers you found to each of the questions.

6. Deploy

Deploying can occur by moving your approach into production or by using your results to persuade others within a company to act on the results. Communication is such an important part of the role of a data scientist.
